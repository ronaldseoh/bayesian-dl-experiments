# bayesian-dl-experiments

This repo contains experimental codes for my current research project on Bayesian deep learning, mainly focusing on the [Monte Carlo dropout](https://link.iamblogger.net/bdlpaper) method. My project intends to provide further analysis on the benefits of MC dropout by empirically evaluating its *practicality* and suggesting considerations to be made when applying the method to real-life models.

**Please stay tuned for updates!**
